# Shiny MMO

Shiny MMO is a super easy web app made with React for helping you following every single permutations for find out your shiny Pok√©mon in new Massive Mass Outbreak (MMO). 

## How it works? 

Thanks to [Austin John Plays's research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqPJnvGJKu8) we discovered that handling the first horde of a MMO changes completely the second horde, granting new shiny possibilities. 

For example, if you catch every single pokemon of the first horde you will get different result that if you defeat two of them in the same battle and catch the others. 

For more informations and for a very detailed video on it, please take a look at the [video of Austin John Plays](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CqPJnvGJKu8).
